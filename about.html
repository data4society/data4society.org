			<h2>Data4Society</h2>
			<p>It’s a community of programmers, web-developers and journalists, whose goal is to strengthen civil society through IT-solutions.</p>
			<h2>Our vision</h2>
			<p>We love data and we love to make this data available to others for their use.</p>
			<p>We believe that in information field supply provoke a demand. Where there aку qualitative and well presented data, a lot of ways for sensible usage of them appear.</p>
			<p>Civil society - both its organised part, NGO’s, and non-organised part, citizens - produce a giant amount of interesting and important data. Data which produce bureaucracy are used for state purpose - for governance and control population. Data which produce people are for better people live. That’s why Data4Society prefer to work not with governmental statistics, but with NGO’s and crowdsource data.</p>
			<p>For better representation of independent data and better understanding the society we develop web projects for NGO’s and grassroots. We  make an emphasis on data collecting, database projects, data visualization and data journalism and promote concepts of open data, open source and creative commons in media and non-governmental area.</p>
