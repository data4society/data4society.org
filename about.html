			<h2>Data4Society</h2>
			<p>Data4Society is a community of programmers, web-developers and journalists, whose goal is to strengthen civil society through IT-solutions.</p>
			<h2>Our vision</h2>
			<p>We love data and we love to make this data available to others for their use.</p>
			<p>We believe that in the information field supply breeds demand. Where there are qualitative and well presented data, a lot of ways for sensible usage of them appear.</p>
			<p>Civil society - both its organised part, NGOs and non-organised part, and its citizens - produces a giant amount of interesting and important data. Data that is produced by bureaucracy are used for state purpose - for governance and control population. Data that is produced by people are for the better lives of the people. That is why Data4Society prefers to work not with governmental statistics, but with data from the NGOs and crowdsource.</p>
			<p>For better representation of independent data and for better understanding of the society we develop web projects for NGOs and grassroots. We make an emphasis on data collecting, database projects, data visualization and data journalism and promote concepts of open data, open source and creative commons in media and non-governmental area.</p>
